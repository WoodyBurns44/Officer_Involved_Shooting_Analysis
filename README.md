I will be analyzing data provided by Vice News about Police Involved shootings across the U.S. The source of the data and raw data can be accessed at this site: https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/a3jjpa/nonfatal-police-shootings-data. Vice collected the data, which is information about shootings involving police, both fatal and non-fatal, from the 50 largest Police Precincts in the U.S. I will attempt to build a model(s) that accurately categorize whether a shooting is fatal or non. Of the most interest to me is the contributing factors, because I am confident that by looking at the coefficients I can get an accurate picture of how the situations differ between Fatal and Non-Fatal instances of police discharging their weapons. With this information, I hope to be able to make recommendations to police departments about actions they can take to minimize the chances of killing their suspects. 

I understand that the Police do their best to protect people, and themselves, from dangerous criminals and that they deal with dangerous situations on a daily basis and are constantly trying to balance apprehending a criminal and making sure that they don't get hurt themselves in the process. With this data I hope to be able to provide valuable information about how Police officers can approach these situations to minimize the chances of anyone dying. 
If we can predict why fatalities happen, maybe we can help reduce the likelihood of them occurring.
